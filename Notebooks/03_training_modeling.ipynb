It has many applications and, much like NLP in general, has seen much improvement over the past few years. In this notebook, we will use our cleaned movie dataset to explore the more common approaches to text summarization and compare which is best. We will use some objective criteria like cosine similarity scores and rouge scores to compare the various methods, but at the time of this writing, nothing evaluates the results of summarization better than humans. Thus, we cannot avoid invoking our own subjective and flawed evaluations.\n",

Party planner Eve (Ryan) is the mother hen of the group, not only of her own family, but also of her siblings and father as their mother, Pat (Leachman), not only emotionally left their father when they divorced, but her daughters as well. Despite being as busy with her own life as the others, Eve is the only one of the three who deals with the long term hospitalization of their cantankerous seventy-nine-year-old father, Lou Mozell, when he enters the early stages of dementia, and the associated outcomes of that hospitalization. Eve’s caring for Lou is despite an especially hurtful incident with him seven years earlier (when he told her she was a mistake). As the emotional aspect of looking after Lou becomes more and more stressful, Eve has to figure out how to maintain her own sanity, while dealing with her sisters, who believe they too are part of their father’s care while they don’t lift a finger to help.  \n",

    " - RNNs usually have fixed size input and output vectors. This is obviously quite undesirable for machine translation. Seq2Seq models can help us solve this problem. How? Because the fixed size output vector generated by the encoder need not be the same size as the input vector give to the decoder. It can be passed in whole or can be connected ot the hidden units of the decoder unit at every time step. \n",
    " - For text summarization, our model will have an encoder that accepts the pre-processed Plot and Overview, trains the model to create an encoded representation, and sends it to a decoder which decodes the endcoded representation into a reliable summary. With more and more training, the model can be used to perform inference on new texts to generate new summaries. "

    " -  What is ROUGE score? ROUGE is actually a set of metrics. ROUGE is comprised of a ROUGE-N (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, etc.), ROUGE-L and sometimes ROUGE-S (not covered here), each of which has a recall, precision and F1 score.\n",
    " -  ROUGE-N: Measures the number of matching 'n-grams' between generated text and the reference text. Thus ROUGE-1 measures the matching number of unigrams (1 token/word). ROUGE-2 measures the matching number of bigrams (2 consecutive tokens/words).\n",
    "     - Recall: counts the number of overlapping n-grams found in both the model output and reference divided by the total number of n-grams in the reference. This ensures our model is getting all the information in the reference, but does NOT ensure our model isn't just producing a large number of words to improve the recall score.\n",
    "     - Precision: counts the number of overlapping n-grams found in the model output and reference, and then divides this by the model n-gram count (rather than the reference n-gram count). This helps us to avoid the problem with recall mentioned above.\n",
    "     - F1: The best of both worlds, F1 is 2 * ((precision * recall) / (precision + recall)). This gives us a nice balance between precision and recall.\n",
    " - ROUGE-L: measures the LCS (longest common sequence) between the model output and the reference. In other words, we count the longest sequence of tokens that is shared between them. Essentially the idea is a longer shared sequence indicates more similarity. Recall, Precision and F1 are used just as before but instead of matched n-grams we use LCS as the numerator."

    "As we can see, the extractive approach scores better on cosine similarity and on the rouge scores. This is to be expected because the extractive approach literally lifts full sentences from the original text. The real test is the human subjective test, and on that the winner goes to the abstractive method. I think the vast majority of people would agree with this. With the extractive approach, the sentences feel out of place or inserted at random and they do not flow together. With the abstractive approach, there is a flow to the sentences, even if the content sometimes doesn't make sense. I think for the average review, one would glean a more accurate summarization of the movie from the abstractive approach."
